# ZooQuest Experience - Complete Refactor Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Transform the ZooQuest Experience app from a mock data system to a fully functional application with real data persistence, proper CRUD operations, and synchronized frontend-backend architecture.

## Current State Analysis
- ‚úÖ Frontend UI components are well-designed and functional
- ‚úÖ Admin panel interface exists but uses mock data
- ‚úÖ Basic routing and authentication flow implemented
- ‚ùå All data comes from hardcoded mockDatabase
- ‚ùå No real CRUD operations (only simulated)
- ‚ùå No data persistence between sessions
- ‚ùå No real image upload functionality
- ‚ùå No synchronization between admin changes and frontend
- ‚ùå Authentication is simulated (not real)

- **File Storage**: Local filesystem (uploads folder)
- **API Architecture**: REST API endpoints
- **Real-time Updates**: Polling initially, WebSockets for future

## Testing Strategy
- Test each phase thoroughly before moving to next
- Create test data for each feature
- Validate data persistence across app restarts
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Performance testing with larger datasets

## Deployment Considerations
- Database migrations strategy
- Environment configuration
- File upload security
- Performance optimization
- Backup and recovery procedures
